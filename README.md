I've struggled working with both MVC and firebase on this assingnment. I did some test projects and figured out the issue, but I would have to restructure a vast majority of my assignment to fix the issue. I'm just going to take the L and lose a few points, I figured it out which is what matters. The main parts of the assignment, such as the login/create account, user information being stored on the firebase server, working lists, and username displayed when logged in, but it doesn't go to a second page. I have it so that the lists are hidden only until you log in. Sorry I couldn't get the second page figured out sooner. Firebase has been interesting to work with to say the least.
